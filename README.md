2024 update: please don't read the code I was cookin something up in sophomore year (but it worked)

# AragonMCPLugin
Our own litte fun mini game written by (mostly) Harish and Kazuya (not really) for our custom map of our highschool (viewer discretion advised, speedran in 3 days for school mc server so its pretty disgusting)

# Usage
Start off each match with the command /startmatch. The plugin will auto disable once the final ring has been reached or if only one player remains. INORDER for new instances of the plugin to work propely, you MUST /reload after every match or else an exception will be thrown by the server

# Dependencies
- Java
- org.bukkit.Bukkit
